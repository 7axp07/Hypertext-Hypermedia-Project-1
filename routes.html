                        Casual Story is the first of three modes available in Mystic Messenger. It is unlocked upon downloading the game and serves as the introductory story for most players.
                        Through Casual Story, the player will be able to obtain the routes of Yoosung, Zen, and Jaehee Kang depending on their responses in the chatrooms during the first four days of the game.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Bad Ending</strong><br />
                        It is possible to obtain a non-route specific Bad Ending on the 5th day of Casual Story if the player misses too many chats, or obtained only Jumin Han / 707's hearts,
                        or did not obtain enough hearts of either one of the three to get a route by Day 5. It is an eerie ending which breaks the "4th wall", where the characters joke that all of them are robots.

                        Deep Story is the <em>second</em> out of the three modes available in Mystic Messenger. Compared to Casual Story, Deep Story focuses more heavily on plot details.
                        Since it requires <strong> 200</strong>  hourglasses to unlock Deep Story mode, it is <em> highly</em>  recommended for players to unlock all three routes available in Casual Story first before proceeding to Deep Story.
                        Through Deep Story, the player will be able to obtain the routes of 707 and Jumin Han depending on their responses in the chatrooms during the first four days of the game. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Bad Ending</strong><br />
                        It is possible to obtain a non-route specific Bad Ending on the 5th day of Deep Story if the player misses too many chats, or obtained only Yoosung / Zen / Jaehee Kang's hearts
                        or did not obtain enough hearts of either one of the two to get a route by Day 5. In this ending, the player is forcibly taken away from Rika's apartament as Seven realizes they
                        [the player] might be in danger if they stay.

                            Another Story was released on <em>September 8, 2017</em>. It features the routes of two characters: V and Ray/Saeran. <br />
                            It costs <strong>550 HG</strong> to fully unlock the mode; costing <strong>300</strong> to unlock V's route and <strong>250</strong> to unlock Ray's route.<br />
                            Unlike in Casual and Deep Story modes, outgoing phone calls cost 10 hourglasses and missed chat rooms cost 15 hourglasses to play in Another Story. The story also takes place 6 months after Rika's "suicide" rather than a year and a half later. <br />
                            Originally, it was only V who was romanceable, however, Ray's route was released on <em>January 31, 2018.</em> <br />
