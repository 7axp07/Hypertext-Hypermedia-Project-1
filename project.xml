				On the surface, Zen is known for being a very eccentric and flirtatious character.
				He will often talk about his looks, praising and complimenting himself for how attractive he is,
				as well as how talented he is when it comes to singing and acting.
				Zen tends to compare others to himself when it comes to looks,
				frequently telling Yoosung to work out to look half as good as he does.
				Despite this, Zen can become very loyal and caring, especially to those he cares about.

				Jumin is a quiet, serious, and cautious man who, as the oldest, acts as the logical and pragmatic voice of the group,
				presenting himself as the most mature.
				Despite this, he is interested in young slang and loves to talk about cats,
				especially his own, Elizabeth 3rd. In fact, in his own way,
				his general cadence will give off that of a child's, often being innocently unaware of many things.
				He's a workaholic.

				For the most part, Seven displays a happy-go-lucky, outgoing, and very bizarre personality.
				However, the player's first impression of Seven is not the "real" Seven.
				Outside the chat room, and behind the humorous front he puts up,
				Seven is actually quite depressed and serious,
				and he refuses to believe that anything good can happen to him.
				This is due to his past and his profession, as he thinks that he will endanger anyone he gets close to.

				V is a person who respects one's privacy.
				This can be seen when he did not know Rika's password even though the apartment was under his name.
				He is also the type who keeps everything to himself,
				to the point where he would rather live with the burden of all his secrets than tell the other RFA members.
				V is timid and faint-hearted, saying that if someone were to be against hosting the party again,
				V would talk about not hosting the party again.
				He is very loyal.
